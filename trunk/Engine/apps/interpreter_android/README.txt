The interpreter_android project is the Android interpreter with all the NDK compiling already done, you do not need to worry about cygwin or NDK with this project. 

It is used to compile the AGK Player for Android, however the latest version should be on the Google Play store so you should not need to build this project, but it is here just in case. If you are looking to build a standalone tier 1 app then use the interpreter_android_prebuilt project

This project does include the jni folder should you need to modify the player source and recompile with the Android NDK.
